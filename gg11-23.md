Led requirements translation for ITSM, HAM, and CMDB workflows across 5+ hospital facilities, converting stakeholder input into structured user stories and functional specifications.
Modeled current-state vs target workflows, clarifying routing logic, lifecycle dependencies, edge cases, and approval behavior across asset and service processes.
Analyzed the lifecycle of ~10,000+ hardware assets, identifying CI relationship inconsistencies, class alignment issues, and reconciliation mismatches, resulting in improved CMDB accuracy and governance reliability.
Cross-verified CMDB data against 3 primary data sources (SCCM, Intune, Absolute) to strengthen asset accuracy and maintain record governance integrity.
Utilized Test Management 2.0 to design, execute, and document regression test cycles for Vancouver upgrade, enabling traceable validation of HAM, CMDB, and catalog workflows with clear defect evidence.
Executed targeted regression testing during Vancouver release, validating 40+ core test scenarios for CMDB and request workflows, ensuring stable post-upgrade outcomes.
Built performance dashboards using ServiceNow reporting to surface trends in CI lifecycle status, discovery gaps, and reconciliation errors, enabling leadership to track governance KPIs.
Contributed to CMDB class modeling and relationship mapping efforts to improve alignment with the Common Service Data Model (CSDM), strengthening support for asset and service traceability.
Identified opportunities for automation within CMDB and asset workflows, recommending Flow Designer logic for lifecycle status transitions and reconciliation alerting to reduce manual intervention.
